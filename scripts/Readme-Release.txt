This release can be installed on Windows 10/11 as follows:

If not done already: Extract the entire zip file into a directory.
Open the directory where it was extracted.
Right-click on Install-OpenKNX-Tools.ps1.
Choose 'Run with PowerShell' and confirm any security warnings by selecting 'Open File' if prompted.
(Now, the tools will be copied to <homedir>/bin -> nothing else happens!)
For MacOS and Linux, the script Build-Release.ps1 should be executed with PowerShell.
We would appreciate any additional installation tips, and we will include them here.

Done.
